# Deep Learning Lab Experiments

Welcome to the **Deep Learning Lab Experiments** repository! This repository contains a collection of experiments performed during my Deep Learning Lab, covering fundamental and advanced concepts in neural networks, optimization, and deep learning architectures.

## 📁 Repository Structure
Each experiment is organized into its own folder, making it easy to navigate and explore different topics. The structure is as follows:

```
📂 Deep-Learning-Lab
│-- 📁 Experiment-1
│   ├── 📄 README.md (Details about the experiment)
│   ├── 📄 experiment_code.py (Python implementation)
│   ├── 📄 Task Assignment 
│-- 📁 Experiment-2
│   ├── ...
│-- 📁 Experiment-N
│   ├── ...
```

## 🔬 Topics Covered
This repository includes experiments on the following topics:
- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** – Forward and backward propagation, activation functions.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** – Image classification, transfer learning.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) & LSTMs** – Sequential data processing.
- **Transformers & Attention Mechanisms** – NLP and vision applications.
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** – Image generation.
- **Optimization Techniques** – SGD, Adam, learning rate schedulers.
- **Autoencoders & Dimensionality Reduction** – Feature learning.
- **Reinforcement Learning** – Basics of Q-learning and policy gradients.

## 🛠️ Requirements
To run the experiments, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras torch torchvision numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/deep-learning-lab.git
   cd deep-learning-lab
   ```
2. Navigate to a specific experiment folder and run the code:
   ```bash
   python experiment_code.py
   ```
3. View the results in the `results/` directory or visualize training performance using TensorBoard.
